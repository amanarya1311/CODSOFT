## 📖 About

This project demonstrates my ability to create an interactive user interface from scratch using core web technologies. The calculator provides functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, decimal operations, and also includes utility functions like backspace and clear. Every aspect—from button behaviour to error handling—is managed through custom JavaScript logic, reinforcing my understanding of **DOM manipulation** and **event-driven programming**.
